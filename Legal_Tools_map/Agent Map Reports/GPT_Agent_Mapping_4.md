## 🔍 Category 1 – International Criminal Tribunals (ICTY‑derived blueprint)

### 1.1 🔢 Case‑number structures

| Tribunal | Numbering pattern | Example cases | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia)** | IT‑YY‑NN \+ optional split (/1, /2) | IT‑00‑39, IT‑01‑42/1, IT‑95‑11[\[1\]](https://www.icty.org/en/cases) | IT identifies the tribunal; YY \= indictment year; NN \= sequential case; slash codes (/1) denote amended indictments or severed defendants. A suffix \-T (trial) or \-A (appeal) appears in documents. |
| **ICTR (International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda)** | ICTR‑YY‑NN \+ letter suffixes | ICTR‑96‑04, ICTR‑05‑86, ICTR‑95‑01A, ICTR‑98‑44I[\[2\]](https://unictr.irmct.org/en/cases#:~:text=AKAYESU%2C%20Jean%20Paul%20%20,Completed%20%20KAMBANDA%2C%20Jean)[\[3\]](https://unictr.irmct.org/en/cases#:~:text=HATEGEKIMANA%2C%20Ildephonse%20%20%20,Transferred%20%20MUNYAGISHARI%2C%20Bernard) | Prefix ICTR signals the tribunal; YY \= year; NN \= sequential case; letters (A,B,C…) indicate joined or split indictments. |
| **SCSL (Special Court for Sierra Leone)** | SCSL‑YY‑NN‑\[stage\] | SCSL‑04‑15‑T (Sesay, Kallon & Gbao trial)[\[4\]](https://www.refworld.org/jurisprudence/caselaw/scsl/2009/en/92027#:~:text=Citation) | YY \= year; NN \= case; stage codes: T (Trial), A (Appeal), AR72(E) (Rule 72 appeal), etc. |
| **ECCC (Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia)** | XX/Date/ECCC/\[Chamber\] | 001/18‑07‑2007/ECCC/TC, 002/19‑09‑2007/ECCC/TC[\[5\]](https://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/792#:~:text=Court%20Extraordinary%20Chambers%20in%20the,2007%2FECCC%2FTC%20Decision%20title%20Judgement)[\[6\]](https://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Case/3312#:~:text=Case%20002%2F01) | The first number (001/002) identifies the case; the date is the intro submission; ECCC denotes the tribunal; final code indicates chamber (TC – Trial Chamber, SC – Supreme Court). |

### 1.2 📑 Universal tribunal access methodology

**Document IDs** contain built‑in metadata; researchers can decode them to filter and retrieve documents:

* **Prefix** identifies the tribunal (e.g., IT, ICTR, SCSL, ECCC).

* **Year code** reveals when the case was initiated.

* **Sequential number** helps to list cases chronologically and find related documents.

* **Suffixes** indicate the procedural stage (Trial/Appeal) or amendments.

* **Split/join markers** (slashes or letters) flag severed defendants or consolidated cases.

📌 *Example:* In ICTR‑96‑04A, A signifies a separate indictment from the same year; the extension helps researchers follow all judgments associated with the same group of defendants.

### 1.3 🧠 Cross‑system relationships

Tribunal cases often cite decisions from other tribunals and international courts. **GlobaLex’s research guide** warns that effective research must encompass the decisions of various tribunals because they *cross‑reference each other*[\[7\]](https://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/un_criminal_tribunals_research_guide1.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20largest%20difficulties,Similarly%2C%20the). Understanding numbering patterns allows scholars to track these citations, build comparative jurisprudence and locate related appeals.

## 🌍 Category 2 – International Legal Instruments (Five sub‑areas)

### 2.1 📜 Citation patterns across treaties & conventions

| Sub‑area & exemplar | Citation pattern & hierarchy | Insights |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Public International Law** |  |  |
|   *Charter of the United Nations* | Cited by volume and page in **UN Treaty Series (UNTS)**: 1 UNTS XVI[\[8\]](https://www.refworld.org/legal/constinstr/un/1945/en/27654#:~:text=Citation). Amendments carry new volume & page numbers (e.g., 557 UNTS 143[\[9\]](https://www.refworld.org/legal/constinstr/un/1945/en/27654#:~:text=The%20Charter%20was%20signed%20at,XXVI%29%20of%2020)). | The UNTS uses Roman numerals for early pages (e.g., XVI). The charter’s amendments are recorded separately with their own UNTS identifiers, demonstrating a hierarchical citation system. |
| **International Criminal Law** |  |  |
|   *Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court* | 2187 U.N.T.S. 90 or 2187 UNTS 3 (depending on the edition)[\[10\]](https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/Rome_Statute_ICC/Rome_ICC_toc.html#:~:text=ROME%20STATUTE%20OF%20THE%20INTERNATIONAL,into%20force%20July%201%2C%202002). | The citation lists the UNTS volume (2187) and starting page. Some sources also cite **International Legal Materials (ILM)** or **Official Records**; the statute entered into force 1 July 2002. |
| **International Human Rights Law** |  |  |
|   *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)* | G.A. res. 2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 52, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966), 999 U.N.T.S. 171, entered into force 23 Mar 1976[\[11\]](https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/b3ccpr.htm#:~:text=International%20Covenant%20on%20Civil%20and,23%2C%201976). | Human‑rights instruments use multiple identifiers: the **UN General Assembly resolution number** (2200A), session (XXI), GAOR volume & supplement, the **UN document symbol** (A/6316), and the **UNTS citation**. This multi‑layered pattern ensures precise sourcing. |
| **International Humanitarian Law** |  |  |
|   *Geneva Convention I (Wounded & Sick)* | 75 U.N.T.S. 31, entered into force 21 Oct 1950[\[12\]](https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/y1gcacws.htm#:~:text=Geneva%20Convention%20for%20the%20Amelioration,21%2C%201950). | Each of the four 1949 Geneva Conventions has its own UNTS volume & page (e.g., Convention II: 75 UNTS 85; Convention III: 75 UNTS 135). The UNTS volume (75) is reused, but page numbers differentiate the conventions. |
| **International Environmental Law** |  |  |
|   *Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)* | 1760 UNTS 79; 31 ILM 818 (1992)[\[13\]](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/databasecil/1992-convention-on-biological-diversity-2/#:~:text=Citations%20to%20Text%201760%20UNTS,Brazil%2C%201992%C2%A0United%20Nations%20Conference%20on). | Many environmental treaties cite both the UNTS and **International Legal Materials** (ILM). The CBD’s citation includes adoption date (5 June 1992) and entry into force (29 Dec 1993), demonstrating that ILM volume and page numbers complement UNTS citations. |

### 2.2 🧭 Systematic access methodology for legal instruments

1. **Identify the instrument’s official title.** Titles sometimes vary (e.g., “Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court” vs. “Statute of the ICC”). Use the formal title for accurate searching.

2. **Determine the citation hierarchy:**  
   *For UN treaties*, note the **UNTS volume and page**; for human‑rights instruments, capture the **GA resolution number**, **session**, and **UN document symbol**.  
   *For regional instruments*, look for regional series (e.g., European Treaty Series (ETS), African Union (AU) instruments).  
   *For environmental agreements*, ILM citations provide alternative access points.

3. **Use adoption and entry‑into‑force dates** to filter results. These dates help differentiate between original instruments and later protocols.

4. **Cross‑references & amendments:** Many instruments are modified by protocols or amendments (e.g., amendments to the UN Charter recorded at 557 UNTS 143[\[9\]](https://www.refworld.org/legal/constinstr/un/1945/en/27654#:~:text=The%20Charter%20was%20signed%20at,XXVI%29%20of%2020)). Always follow the chain of amendments for the most current text.

5. **Link to treaty databases:** UN Treaty Series (UNTS) volumes and page numbers allow direct retrieval from the UN’s treaty database. For environmental or human‑rights treaties, ILM and other series provide additional entry points.

### 2.3 📖 Cross‑system citation patterns

* **General Assembly & Security Council resolutions** are cited as G.A. Res. \[number\] (\[session\]/\[year\]) or S.C. Res. \[number\] (\[year\]). Example: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is *G.A. Res. 217A (III)*, and the Security Council’s counter‑terrorism resolution is *S.C. Res. 1373 (2001)*. These patterns mirror tribunal case‑number suffixes (stage/year) and are essential for tracing preparatory work.

* **UN document symbols** (e.g., A/6316, S/RES/1373) provide a stable identifier; the prefix letter indicates the organ (A – General Assembly, S – Security Council), followed by a document number.

* **International Law Reports & ILM**: citations often include *ILM* volume & page numbers (e.g., 31 ILM 818 for the CBD[\[13\]](https://cil.nus.edu.sg/databasecil/1992-convention-on-biological-diversity-2/#:~:text=Citations%20to%20Text%201760%20UNTS,Brazil%2C%201992%C2%A0United%20Nations%20Conference%20on)), offering alternative sources when UNTS volumes are unavailable.

## 🔗 Relationship between Tribunals & Instruments

* Tribunal judgments rely heavily on **treaties**; for instance, ICTR cases interpret the Genocide Convention, while ICC cases apply the Rome Statute. Recognising numbering patterns in both categories helps cross‑reference case law and underlying instruments.

* **GlobaLex** notes that tribunal case numbers can signal changes (such as amendments or joinder) and that research across tribunals is essential because cases often *cite each other’s decisions and apply principles from different courts*[\[7\]](https://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/un_criminal_tribunals_research_guide1.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20largest%20difficulties,Similarly%2C%20the).

* Document collections (e.g., the **Legal Tools Database** or **Refworld**) organise materials by tribunal or instrument; understanding the numbering schema ensures efficient filtering.

## ✅ Conclusion & Universal Access Blueprint

By decoding the **numerical language** of international law—whether case numbers or treaty citations—we unlock a *universal access methodology*:

1. **Decode prefixes and codes** to identify tribunals, year, case sequence or treaty series.

2. **Track procedural stages or amendments** using suffixes or separate UNTS volumes.

3. **Use cross‑references** (GA/SC resolutions, UN docs) to trace preparatory works and interpretive guidance.

4. **Leverage multiple databases** (UNTS, ILM, tribunal websites, research guides) to ensure comprehensive coverage.

5. **Appreciate inter‑tribunal citations** and update research accordingly—no tribunal operates in isolation.

This systematic approach ensures researchers like **VG** can navigate complex databases and extract relevant documents efficiently, turning scattered legal materials into an integrated knowledge network.
