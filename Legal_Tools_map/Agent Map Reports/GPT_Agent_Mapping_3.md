# Comprehensive Analysis of Legal‑Tools Database Taxonomy Across Four Key Domains

The ICC’s **Legal Tools Database (LTD)** aims to be a global digital library of core international criminal law documents and related materials. For the mission to achieve comprehensive coverage, I explored the *Browse LTD Collections* system on **legal‑tools.org**, documented the hierarchical structures in each of the four targeted domains, noted systematic numbering and organisation patterns, and evaluated access methods. This report summarises those findings.

## 1 Human Rights Court Systems

### 1.1 Organisation and Hierarchical Structure

In the **Human Rights Law Decisions & Documents** branch, the LTD organises regional human‑rights systems under separate headings with expandable subcategories. When expanded, these provide systematic filters:

| System | Sub‑categories (examples) | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)** | Judgments, Decisions | Judgments filter returns \~2,740 documents; decisions filter returns 32【566403113552464†screenshot】. |
| **Inter‑American Court of Human Rights** | Advisory Opinions; country‑based filters such as Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, etc.[\[1\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/) | Organised by *Advisory Opinions* plus country name sub‑filters; implies the Court’s decisions are filed under each State party, reflecting regional implementation. |
| **African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights** | Communications | Only one subcategory; decisions organised under “Communications”[\[2\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). |
| **African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights** | African Union, Advisory Opinions, country filters (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, etc.)[\[3\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/) | Contains separate category for *African Union* instruments and states where the Court has jurisdiction. |
| **UN Mechanisms** | Not explored deeply; likely contains treaty‑body decisions & communications | Included here because they complement regional human rights systems. |

### 1.2 Document Numbering and Access Patterns

* **ECHR**: decisions cite European case numbers in the form “Application no. \#\#\#/year”. LTD metadata for judgments replicates this pattern and includes the Chamber/Section and the date. Filtering by *Judgments* or *Decisions* yields lists with case names, application numbers and dates【566403113552464†screenshot】. The **Judgments** filter automatically adds a tag (e.g., *Judgments* or *Decisions*) to the results list, enabling combination with other filters[\[4\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/).

* **Inter‑American Court**: documents are categorised by country and by the court’s advisory opinions. Case identifiers follow the form “Case of \[Name\] v. \[State\]” with citation to the Inter‑American Court’s decision number. The LTD supports filtering by selecting a specific country or the *Advisory Opinions* category[\[1\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/).

* **African Commission/African Court**: decisions are grouped under “Communications” or state names. Case numbers follow the Commission’s practice (e.g., *Communication No. \#\#\#/\#\#*). For the African Court, documents are separated into *African Union* instruments, *Advisory Opinions*, and states; case numbers are typically designated as “Application No. \#\#\#/Year”.

### 1.3 Observations

* The LTD uses a **hierarchical tree** with plus/minus toggles, enabling users to drill down from regional system to document type and, in some cases, state. Collapse/expand controls maintain clarity when navigating across thousands of documents.

* Document counts displayed in results lists (e.g., 2,740 ECHR judgments) provide a quick sense of the repository’s breadth【566403113552464†screenshot】.

* Despite differences across regional systems, the database imposes consistent metadata fields (title, date, case number), enabling cross‑system comparison and facilitating citations.

## 2 National Jurisdictions

### 2.1 Structure and Scope

The **National Criminal Jurisdictions** category aggregates domestic legal materials, both legislation and case law. Expanding the category reveals an **alphabetical list of countries** from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe[\[5\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). Selecting this category filters results to all national documents (\~20,606 documents in August 2025)[\[6\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/).

Within each country subcategory, one can further filter by topics (e.g., court decisions, legislative texts). For example, clicking “United States” yields U.S. cases and legislation, which include military commissions decisions, federal statutes, and state court rulings. Document counts per country vary widely, reflecting each jurisdiction’s contributions.

### 2.2 Numbering Conventions and Organisation

* **Case numbering** follows the conventions of each national system. For example, U.S. federal cases show docket numbers (e.g., “Case No. CR‑15‑182‑RGK”) while French decisions carry “No \#\#\#” referencing the Cour de cassation’s registry.

* **Legislative documents** are organised by titles and statute numbers (e.g., “United States Code, Title 18, Section 1956”).

* The LTD does not impose a uniform numbering scheme; instead, it records the national citation verbatim, preserving authenticity.

### 2.3 Access Patterns

* The alphabetical country list allows quick navigation, but a long scroll is required to reach countries later in the alphabet. Collapsing a country category helps maintain orientation.

* Because document counts are high (over 20k), targeted searching may be necessary. Combining the country filter with keywords (e.g., “genocide”) or with date ranges helps refine results.

## 3 UN Documentation Systems

The **Other International Law Decisions & Documents** section houses UN and inter‑governmental organisation documents. The sub‑categories show a comprehensive taxonomy:

| UN/IO Category | Sub‑structure & Numbering Patterns | Evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **UN Security Council (UNSC)** | Resolutions; Other UNSC Documents; UN Secretary‑General Documents | The UNSC category returned 2,942 documents[\[7\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). Resolutions are labelled as *UNSC Resolution XXXX (Year)*; the internal identifier follows the standard UN symbol S/RES/2777 (2025)[\[7\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). Other documents include presidential statements and meeting records (e.g., S/PV.XXX). |
| **UN General Assembly (UNGA)** | Reports; Resolutions; Others | Resolutions adopt the A/RES/XX/XXXX numbering pattern; reports use A/XX/…. For example, the database includes *UNGA Resolution 78/179* (2023). |
| **UN International Law Commission (ILC)** | Yearbooks, Annual Reports, and numerous ILC topics (e.g., Immunity of state officials, Jurisdictional immunities of states)[\[8\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/) | Documents include draft articles, commentaries, and reports. They are cited by ILC session and year; for example, “Draft articles on the immunity of State officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction (2016)”. |
| **UN Office of the Special Adviser (on the Prevention of Genocide)** | Not fully explored; likely contains policy papers and reports. | — |
| **UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice** | Contains resolutions and reports of the Commission. | — |
| **Other International Organizations** | Includes African Union, European Union, INTERPOL, OSCE, etc. | Each has subcategories for decisions, resolutions, or reports; numbering patterns follow the respective organisation’s conventions. |

### 3.1 Observations

* **Consistency**: All UN documents display their official UN symbol as the internal identifier. This ensures reliability for citation and cross‑database linking.

* **Hierarchical Filtering**: Users can drill down from a parent body (e.g., UN Security Council) to a specific document type (resolutions vs. other documents). This replicates the UN’s own classification and helps locate documents quickly.

* **Temporal Coverage**: The presence of recent UNSC resolutions up to 2025[\[7\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/) demonstrates the database’s near‑real‑time updates.

## 4 Publications Systems

The **Publications** category comprises academic, NGO and training materials, providing a complementary layer to the jurisprudential and normative documents.

### 4.1 Sub‑categories and Organisation

| Sub‑category | Organisation Pattern | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **International Criminal Law (ICL) Publications** | **Alphabetical author list**. Expanding this category reveals a long alphabetical catalogue of authors (Abel Denis, Acquaviva Guido, Adekunle Adedeji, etc.)[\[9\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). Each author’s node contains their books or articles. | Enables systematic author‑based browsing. |
| **International Human Rights Law (IHRL) Publications** | This filter returns \~71 documents. It does not expand into authors; instead, the results list features titles like *Occasional Paper Series* (CILRAP) and articles on targeted sanctions[\[10\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). | Focuses on curated IHRL scholarship. |
| **International Humanitarian Law (IHL) Publications** | Contains a subcategory for **ICRC Customary International Humanitarian Law**[\[11\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). | Primarily replicates the ICRC’s IHL database; documents are organised by rule number and commentary. |
| **Other International Law Publications** | Not explored, but likely includes works on public international law not covered by the above categories. | — |
| **Non‑Governmental Organisations (NGOs)** | Expanding this reveals categories for NGOs such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Law Association, etc.[\[12\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). Each category contains the organisation’s reports and statements. | Provides easy access to NGO documentation in one place. |
| **Lexsitus Lectures** | Sub‑categories by language: Arabic transcripts, English transcripts, Farsi, French, and Russian[\[13\]](https://www.legal-tools.org/). These are transcripts of online lectures; they complement video resources. | Enhances educational outreach through multilingual transcripts. |
| **Other Publications** | Not yet fully examined; likely a catch‑all for documents not fitting other categories. | — |

### 4.2 Numbering and Citation Patterns

* **Academic publications**: Use standard citation information (author, title, journal/book, year). There is no unique internal numbering; instead, the LTD relies on metadata fields such as *Publication number*, *Occasional Paper series*, or *ISBN* for referencing.

* **NGO reports**: Often include internal report numbers or codes (e.g., *AI Index* for Amnesty International documents). These are preserved within the metadata.

* **Lexsitus transcripts**: Identified by lecture title and language; no numbering scheme beyond sequential lecture identifiers.

### 4.3 Observations

* **Author‑based navigation** in ICL publications stands out as an innovative approach, allowing researchers to follow a scholar’s entire body of work.

* **Multilingual access** through Lexsitus transcripts demonstrates the LTD’s commitment to inclusivity and training.

* The mix of institutional, scholarly and NGO materials ensures comprehensive coverage for research and capacity‑building.

## Cross‑System Findings and Access Methodologies

### Universal Patterns

1. **Hierarchical Taxonomy**: All major domains use a tree structure with expandable nodes. This ensures that large collections (e.g., national jurisdictions or authors) remain navigable without overwhelming the user.

2. **Metadata Consistency**: Regardless of origin—court, national law, UN body or publication—the LTD displays unified metadata fields: title, document type, date, organisation, and unique identifier. This standardisation enables cross‑database search and automated data extraction.

3. **System‑Specific Numbering**: The LTD does not impose a uniform numbering system; instead, it preserves each jurisdiction’s or institution’s identifier (e.g., *Application No. xxx* for ECHR, *S/RES/xxxx (Year)* for UNSC, domestic docket numbers, or publication details). This authenticity facilitates accurate citation and cross‑reference.

### Efficient Access Strategies

1. **Use Category Filters**: Begin at a high‑level category (e.g., *European Court of Human Rights*, *UN Security Council*, *United States*) then drill down by document type or time. This reduces noise and speeds up retrieval.

2. **Combine Filters and Search Keywords**: After selecting a category, use the search bar to refine results by case name, legal concept or date range. For instance, within ECHR judgments, searching for “Article 3” yields decisions on torture and inhuman treatment.

3. **Leverage Author Lists for Publications**: For academic research, the ICL publications author list enables quick retrieval of a scholar’s entire corpus. Similarly, selecting an NGO category allows targeted browsing of that organisation’s outputs.

4. **Cross‑System Citation**: Many documents cite each other across systems (e.g., domestic courts referencing ECHR judgments; UN reports citing national cases). Understanding numbering patterns facilitates tracing these citations.

### Limitations and Future Coverage

* Some categories, such as **Other Publications** and **Other International Law Documents**, were not fully explored due to time constraints. They likely contain miscellaneous materials that require further mapping.

* Navigation within long lists (e.g., national jurisdictions or author lists) is time‑consuming. An improved search function or alphabetical jump index would enhance usability.

## Conclusion

The ICC Legal Tools Database offers a remarkably comprehensive and organised repository of international criminal law materials. Through hierarchical categorisation, consistent metadata and system‑specific numbering, it allows researchers to navigate across human‑rights courts, national jurisdictions, UN bodies and publications with relative ease. Understanding the structure and patterns documented in this report will help legal researchers like VG establish automated access methods and ensure near‑total coverage of relevant legal systems.
