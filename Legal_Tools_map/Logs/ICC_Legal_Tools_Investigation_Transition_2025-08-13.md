# üìã **Transition Document: ICC Legal Tools Investigation - August 13, 2025**

## **Mission Overview**
**Primary Goal:** Achieve inference-based retrieval against tribunal legal databases without mass downloading. Target remote data access where our queries hit their servers directly, avoiding local storage of massive datasets.

**Target Databases:**
- legal-tools.org (ICC documents)
- cld.irmct.org (ICTY/ICTR cases) 
- casematrixnetwork.org (ICC case matrix)

## **Investigation Summary**

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working Methods**
**Legal-Tools PDF Direct Access:**
- **Pattern:** `https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/{DOC_ID}/pdf`
- **Example:** `https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/7441a2/pdf` (1.4MB PDF confirmed)
- **Status:** Fully functional for document retrieval

### ‚ùå **Methods Ruled Out**
**JSON/API Endpoints:**
- Comprehensive diagnostic testing completed via `tribunal_diagnostic_v1.py`
- All `/api/*` paths return real 404 errors on Legal-Tools
- CLD `/assets/filings/` pattern tested - no valid filing IDs found
- Legal-Tools uses React SPA fallback for invalid document paths
- **Conclusion:** No hidden JSON APIs exist on either platform

**SSL Bypass Theory:**
- ChatGPT Agent's SSL certificate theory was incorrect
- Both curl and Python with `verify=False` return same 404 responses
- Issue is invalid filing IDs, not SSL verification

### üîç **Key Discoveries**

**Legal-Tools Internal Structure (from book indexes):**
- **75+ metadata fields** in systematic schema
- **LT-External identifier** (field #7) - document ID system
- **LT-Database record number** (field #75) - alternative numbering
- **Case Matrix Logic** adopted by ICC (direct connection to casematrixnetwork.org)
- Systematic document organization with relationship mapping

**React SPA Architecture:**
- Legal-Tools serves main React app for unrecognized routes
- Real API paths (`/api/*`) return genuine 404s
- Document data loaded internally via JavaScript, not external APIs

**CLD Response Pattern:**
- Server recognizes `/assets/filings/` path structure
- Returns CLD-specific 404 pages (not generic errors)
- Indicates path exists but needs valid filing IDs

## **Critical Intelligence Gathered**

**Legal Tools Metadata Manual Analysis:**
- Comprehensive 78-page metadata schema documentation
- ICC naming conventions with detailed rules
- Document relationship mapping system
- Subject classification framework
- Access level control mechanisms

**Book Index Reveals:**
- "Case Matrix Logic" adoption by ICC chambers
- Systematic approach to legal document organization
- Connection between Legal-Tools and Case Matrix Network
- Evidence of programmatic structure behind the interface

## **Current Status: Ready for Deep Research Phase**

### **Immediate Next Steps Planned**
1. **Deep Research Query:** Extract systematic access patterns from Legal Tools book
2. **Document ID Discovery:** Reverse-engineer Legal Tools' ID generation logic
3. **Case Matrix Connection:** Map relationships between platforms using book intelligence

### **Technical Assets Created**
- `tribunal_diagnostic_v1.py` - Comprehensive endpoint testing script
- `tribunal_diagnostic_results.json` - Detailed findings database
- `icc mapping.md` - Initial investigation documentation

## **Key Insight**
The metadata manual reveals Legal-Tools has **systematic internal structure** - not random document organization. This suggests **programmatic access patterns exist** but require understanding their internal logic rather than traditional API approaches.

## **Goal Alignment**
Investigation maintains focus on **inference-based retrieval** - queries hitting their servers directly without local mass storage. PDF access pattern confirms this approach is viable if we can systematically discover document IDs.

**Status:** Investigation phase complete. Ready for deep research analysis of Legal Tools documentation to extract systematic access patterns.
