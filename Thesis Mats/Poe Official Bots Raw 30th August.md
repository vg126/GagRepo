Bot image for ElevenLabs-v3
ElevenLabs-v3
ElevenLabs v3 is a cutting-edge text-to-speech model that brings scripts to life with remarkable realism and performance-level control. Unlike traditional TTS systems, it allows creators to shape the emotional tone, pacing, and soundscape of their audio through the use of inline audio tags. These tags are enclosed in square brackets and act as stage directions—guiding how a line is spoken or what sound effects are inserted—without being spoken aloud. This enables rich, expressive narration and dialogue for applications like audiobooks, games, podcasts, and interactive media. Whether you’re aiming for a tense whisper, a sarcastic remark, or a dramatic soundscape full of explosions and ambient effects, v3 gives you granular control directly in the text prompt. This bot will also run text-to-speech on PDF attachments / URL links. Examples of voice delivery tags include: * [whispers] I have to tell you a secret. * [angry] That was *never* the plan. * [sarcastic] Oh, sure. That’ll totally work. * and [laughs] You're hilarious. Examples of sound effect tags are: * [gunshot] Get down! * [applause] Thank you, everyone. * and [explosion] What was that?! These can also be combined. Multiple speakers can be supported via the parameter control. Dialogue for multiple speakers must follow the format, e.g. for 3 speakers: Speaker 1: [dialogue] Speaker 2: [dialogue] Speaker 3: [dialogue] Speaker 1: [dialogue] Speaker 2: [dialogue] --speaker_count 3 --voice_1 [voice_1] --voice_2 [voice_2] --voice_3 [voice_3]

Bot image for TopazLabs
TopazLabs
Topaz Labs’ image upscaler is a best-in-class generative AI model to increase overall clarity and the pixel amount of inputted photos — whether they be ones generated by AI image models and from the real world — while preserving the original photo’s contents. It can produce images of as small as ~10MB and as large as 512MB, depending on the size of the input photo. Specify --upscale and a number up to 16 to control the upscaling factor, output_height and/or output_width to specify the number of pixels for each dimension, and add --generated if the input photo is AI-generated. With no parameters specified, it will increase both input photo’s height and width by 2; especially effective on images of human faces.
