## 2. Introduction
This thesis begins with a provocation: what if legal redundancy at the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not merely a sign of institutional inefficiency, but a window into the deeper semiotics of legitimacy, time, and legal discourse? The project traces its conceptual origins to Hiroyuki Tosa’s account of the ICC’s dualistic structure—simultaneously performative and exclusionary—a characterization that illuminated the cultural and structural tensions in global criminal justice. This insight, encountered during the researcher’s LLM work, formed the kernel of the present inquiry.  
The ICC presents a unique methodological opportunity. Its transparent documentation, robust procedural record, and legal openness offer an ideal site to test whether AI-driven pattern analysis can reveal latent procedural signals. The thesis engages the ICC not as a failed project, but as a valuable epistemic laboratory: a space where legal complexity and cultural signaling intersect.  
The core hypothesis is that redundancy in ICC jurisprudence—once dismissed as mere excess—is, in fact, a juridical signal. It performs multiple, even contradictory, roles: shielding institutional discretion, delaying accountability, and at times, performing legitimacy itself. This diagnostic view is advanced through both legal argumentation and AI-enabled modeling. Redundancy is thus studied as symptom, message, and structural feature—an unavoidable residue of institutional anxiety.

## 3. Literature Review
This literature review situates the thesis within five interconnected bodies of scholarship: classical legal theory, ICC doctrinal critique, AI legal language processing, postcolonial critique, and foundational justice theory. Together, they provide the scaffolding for a multi-dimensional inquiry into legal redundancy and institutional legitimacy.  
**Redundancy in Law and Jurisprudence**  
Hart’s "Concept of Law" provides the jurisprudential grounding for examining legal redundancy not as error but as structural reinforcement. His distinction between primary and secondary rules helps conceptualize redundancy as stabilizing feature rather than malfunction.  
**Critical Scholarship on the ICC**  
Works by Stahn, Schabas, and Bassiouni collectively map the ICC’s legitimacy crisis, procedural entrenchments, and structural ambiguities. Stahn’s engagement with complementarity and Bassiouni’s account of legislative negotiation highlight redundancy as both a functional by-product and a tactical construct.  
**AI and Legal Language**  
Vaswani et al.’s Transformer model inaugurates a paradigm shift in language analysis. This architecture underpins the thesis’ methodology, positioning AI not only as analytical tool but as infrastructure for legal diagnostics. It enables pattern recognition across complex procedural records otherwise imperceptible to doctrinal analysis.  
**Postcolonial and Critical Legal Theory**  
Tosa’s depiction of the ICC’s duality—universalist in vision, exclusionary in execution—connects directly to the thesis’ argument about institutional signaling. Chimni’s TWAIL critique and Baxi’s emphasis on suffering and justice further contextualize legal redundancy within global hierarchies.  
**Foundational Jurisprudence and Justice Theories**  
Dworkin’s law-as-integrity model and Baxi’s human rights critique furnish normative counterpoints. These thinkers help frame redundancy as an interpretive and ethical concern, especially when AI systems replicate or exacerbate legal blind spots.  
Additionally, literature on model chaining, sentence transformation frameworks, and cross-domain semantic compression—including data practices drawn from postcolonial linguistics and rhetorical theory—are critical to the training-data phase of this thesis’ experimental method. These sources underpin the project’s innovative use of curated, domain-specific transformations for AI-facilitated legal modeling.

## 4. Research Questions / Objectives
This thesis is guided by the recognition that international criminal law operates through structural ambiguity, recursive legitimation, and procedural time. To navigate these dynamics, the following research questions frame the inquiry:  
**Research Questions:**  
- How does procedural redundancy at the ICC signal legitimacy, exhaustion, or institutional camouflage—and can AI distinguish between these?  
- What distinguishes harmful redundancy from generative repetition within ICC legal discourse, and how can this be diagnosed methodologically?  
- How does procedural time affect the ICC’s justice claims, and how does delay convert law into performance?  
- Can AI systems enhance institutional transparency by mapping discourse structure rather than doctrinal outcomes?  
- How can a model-chaining architecture capture the ICC’s polyphonic legal voice—spanning humanitarian, legal-rational, and political-sovereign registers?  
- To what extent does legal form internalize uncertainty, and how do AI systems render this legible across filings and case history?  
- Can AI-driven diagnostics reveal interpretive drift, performative saturation, or procedural opacity in ways unavailable to traditional legal analysis?  
**Research Objectives:**  
- To reconceptualize redundancy in international criminal law as a complex legal-semantic phenomenon, not merely a bureaucratic failure.  
- To construct and deploy a model-chaining AI methodology that interprets ICC procedural data with attention to semantic layering and discursive drift.  
- To critically evaluate the epistemological shifts introduced by AI in legal reasoning, especially in revealing structures of delay and redundancy.  
- To contribute a postcolonial, interdisciplinary framework for understanding the ICC’s legal communication as an exercise in legitimacy performance.  
- To explore the potential and limits of AI as a diagnostic infrastructure in legal scholarship, with the human interpreter as terminal authority.

## 5. Methodology
This thesis employs a layered methodology that synthesizes doctrinal legal analysis, postcolonial critique, and AI-enabled interpretive modeling. It is structured around a system known as PFI: Parser, Function Executors (F1–F3), and Instruct model.  
At its core, the methodology replaces monolithic legal interpretation with modular analysis. The parser preprocesses ICC legal data (primarily Articles 17–20), routing it to three function-executing models (F1–F3). These models apply sentence transformation frameworks—drawn from domains like rhetorical theory, set-theory logic, postcolonial linguistics, and diagnostic protocol—to generate structured interpretations. Their outputs are then aggregated and refined by the Instruct model, which serves a trained human user seeking to reduce legal indeterminacy.  
Training data was constructed using Gemini and Claude via deep research prompts targeting multiple compression and analysis domains (e.g., stasis theory, chess notation, musical grammar, differential diagnosis). These training sets were custom-curated and iteratively expanded with human oversight, forming a unique multi-perspectival corpus.  
Unlike end-to-end fine-tuning, this method embraces chaining for modularity, transparency, and critique. Chaining accommodates interpretive drift while enabling precise functional segmentation. It reflects a rejection of optimization in favor of epistemic accountability—reinforcing that AI in law should diagnose, not automate.  
Finally, human-in-the-loop logic is essential. The user remains both target and filter, interpreting AI-processed legal outputs within institutional, ethical, and emotional constraints. This is not a closed system: it is a recursive, pedagogical one. The methodology thus performs not only legal reasoning but legal reasoning about AI itself.

## 7. Findings / Contributions
This thesis advances legal scholarship, artificial intelligence (AI) methodology, and institutional analysis by introducing original frameworks and approaches to the study of redundancy within the International Criminal Court (ICC). Drawing on interdisciplinary insights and a novel AI-driven methodology, it offers the following key contributions:

1. **Reconceptualization of Redundancy as a Legal-Semantic Condition**  
   This research redefines redundancy at the ICC not as mere inefficiency but as a structural and semantic phenomenon intrinsic to its operation. Informed by the concept of *future-priming*—a dynamic optimization strategy contrasted with rigid future-proofing—the thesis posits redundancy as a resilience mechanism. It buffers the ICC against abrupt shifts in legal, political, and epistemic contexts, challenging conventional critiques of institutional design and offering a new lens for understanding procedural saturation.

2. **Development of a Model-Chaining AI Methodology**  
   A modular AI system, comprising a Parser and Function Executors (F1–F3) guided by an Instruct model, is developed to interpret ICC procedural data. This methodology leverages chaining for transparency and adaptability, aligning with the principle of *conclusion instability as method*. By prioritizing dynamic hypotheses over static outputs, it reflects the *Neothesis*—a form of thought designed for rapidly evolving knowledge landscapes—and provides a scalable tool for legal analysis.

3. **Introduction of the Instantaneous Theorem and Many Frames Hypothesis**  
   Two novel frameworks emerge from this research:  
   - The *Instantaneous Theorem* asserts that justice claims must be theoretically realizable in an instant to retain legitimacy. It reveals how procedural delays transform legal processes into performances of authority rather than substantive outcomes.  
   - The *Many Frames Hypothesis* recognizes the ICC’s discourse as polyphonic, spanning humanitarian, legal-rational, and political-sovereign registers. These frameworks offer diagnostic tools for analyzing institutional legitimacy and interpretive complexity.

4. **Formulation of a Postcolonial and Neurodivergent-Informed Framework**  
   Integrating postcolonial theory and the researcher’s neurodivergent perspective (e.g., ADHD), this thesis frames the ICC’s legal communication as a contested site of legitimacy. Neurodivergence is positioned as a methodological asset, enhancing sensitivity to high-velocity knowledge shifts and aligning with *future-primed* cognition. This interdisciplinary approach enriches critical legal studies by foregrounding alternative epistemic standpoints.

5. **Critical Exploration of AI as a Diagnostic Infrastructure**  
   The thesis evaluates AI’s role in legal reasoning, emphasizing its capacity to expose redundancies and delays while preserving human interpretive agency. Grounded in the *Neothesis* and the synchronization of observation and change layers, it advocates for AI as a diagnostic partner rather than an autonomous arbiter, contributing to debates on technology’s place in legal scholarship.

These contributions collectively propose a paradigm shift in how legal theory, AI, and institutional critique intersect. By embracing *redundancy justified* as a strategic buffer and advancing a *living thesis framework*, this research not only critiques the ICC’s operational realities but also lays the groundwork for adaptive, technology-augmented legal analysis.

Core Thesis Ideas

---------------------


1. Redundancy as Legal Diagnostic
Redundancy in law—repetitions, overlaps, and procedural excess—is not merely a sign of inefficiency but a key indicator of the legal system’s internal logic. It reflects the institution’s attempt to stabilize meaning, hedge against uncertainty, and assert legitimacy. By examining where and how redundancy appears, one can uncover the hidden operations, anxieties, or power strategies within legal architectures.

2. Legitimacy Over Efficiency
Institutions are not sustained by procedural speed but by perceptions of fairness, deliberation, and moral authority. Legitimacy is performative: it is constructed through public rituals, layered procedures, and visible due process. This principle elevates trust and symbolic coherence over operational streamlining.

3. Procedural Complexity as Cultural Artifact
Legal complexity should be understood as an expression of institutional culture, not a flaw. Multilayered procedures, interpretive ambiguities, and baroque structures reflect historical tensions, political pressures, and normative commitments embedded in the legal system. Complexity is intentional, not incidental.

4. AI as Epistemic Actor
Artificial intelligence, particularly language models, are not passive tools but active participants in knowledge formation. They generate interpretive pathways, identify hidden patterns, and reframe institutional behaviors. In doing so, AI reshapes what is visible, thinkable, and actionable within legal systems.

5. Semantic Violence and the Attention Economy
Legal language can inflict harm not through what it says, but through how much, how often, and with what saturation. When repetition exceeds clarity, and technical language floods interpretive space, access to justice becomes obstructed. This is semantic violence—where law’s excess becomes a tool of exclusion or obfuscation.

6. Many Frames Hypothesis
Legal meaning is never fixed. It shifts depending on the interpretive frame: humanitarian, procedural, geopolitical, ethical. Legal texts are polyphonic, containing multiple coexisting rationalities. Understanding law requires embracing its multi-framed nature rather than reducing it to a single perspective.

7. Instantaneous Theorem of Justice
Justice is not only about substance but timing. A legal response must be temporally proximate to the harm it addresses, or it risks transforming justice into spectacle or irrelevance. Delayed justice erodes legitimacy and can itself become a form of epistemic or procedural violence.

8. Transparency as Diagnostic Infrastructure
Transparency is not just disclosure but a structural condition enabling critique. It refers to the capacity to trace decisions, identify patterns, and understand procedural flow. Transparency becomes an infrastructure that reveals how institutions think and act, making them open to audit and reform.

9. Internalization vs Distributed Cognition
Legal interpretation can be centralized in human judges or distributed across networks—including AI systems, precedents, and institutional routines. This axiom contrasts interpretive closure (internalization) with modular, distributed legal cognition that allows for pluralistic and decentralized knowledge generation.

10. Consumption as Interpretive End Point
Legal systems do not only decide or interpret—they consume meaning. Through repeated framing, citation, and procedural looping, law exhausts interpretive possibilities, arriving not at truth but at saturation. This “consumption” of meaning marks the point where law shifts from openness to closure.
